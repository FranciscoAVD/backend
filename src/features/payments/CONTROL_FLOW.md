# Payments control flow

This documents how `src/features/payments` actually behaves at runtime. See the
[README](../../../README.md#payments) for the endpoint table and the two-plan-type summary.

## Overview: where the two plan types diverge

`plan.type` decides which of two entirely separate systems handles the purchase.
`recurring` is better-auth's own stripe plugin (its own tables, its own webhook
handling); `one_time` is this feature's own Checkout + webhook + `purchase` table.
This doc only covers the `one_time` path in detail.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Client wants to buy a plan"] --> B{"plan.type?"}
    B -- recurring --> C["better-auth /api/auth/subscription/upgrade\n(subscription table, handled entirely by @better-auth/stripe)"]
    B -- one_time --> D["POST /api/payments/checkout\n(this feature's own flow, detailed below)"]
```

## `POST /checkout`: creating a one-time Checkout Session

`route.ts`'s handler, in the order the checks actually run. The two guards under
`plan.repeatable` close the realistic "two tabs" race (a user opening a second
checkout before the first confirms); they can't close every race - see
`confirmCheckout`'s own re-check further down for the narrower one that reaches
the webhook anyway.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start(["POST /checkout { planId }"]) --> LookupPlan["paymentsRepo.plan.get(planId)"]
    LookupPlan -->|db error| Err500a["500"]
    LookupPlan --> PlanExists{"plan exists\n&& plan.active?"}
    PlanExists -- no --> NotFound["404 Plan not found"]
    PlanExists -- yes --> IsOneTime{"plan.type === one_time?"}
    IsOneTime -- no --> Unprocessable["422 Plan is not a one-time plan"]
    IsOneTime -- yes --> Repeatable{"plan.repeatable?"}

    Repeatable -- yes --> EnsureCustomer
    Repeatable -- no --> CheckOwned["paymentsRepo.purchase.getBlockingByPlan(userId, planId)\n(paid or disputed - only refunded frees the slot)"]
    CheckOwned -->|db error| Err500b["500"]
    CheckOwned --> AlreadyOwns{"a blocking purchase\nalready exists?"}
    AlreadyOwns -- yes --> Audit1["audit log: checkout_blocked_existing_purchase\n(best-effort)"]
    Audit1 --> Conflict["409 You've already purchased this plan"]
    AlreadyOwns -- no --> CheckPending["hasActivePendingCheckout(userId, planId)\n(Redis pointer, no Stripe call yet)"]
    CheckPending -->|redis error| Err500e["500"]
    CheckPending --> HasPending{"an open/processing\ncheckout already exists?"}
    HasPending -- yes --> Audit2["audit log: checkout_blocked_pending_checkout\n(best-effort)"]
    Audit2 --> Conflict2["409 You already have a checkout\nin progress for this plan"]
    HasPending -- no --> EnsureCustomer

    EnsureCustomer["paymentsRepo.customer.ensure(id, name, email)\n(always re-reads the live user row itself -\nnever trusts a caller-supplied id, which can\nbe a stale cached session - see below)"] -->|stripe/db error| Err500c["500"]
    EnsureCustomer --> CreateSession

    CreateSession["createCheckout:\nstripe.checkout.sessions.create\n(mode: payment, customer: stripeCustomerId)"] -->|stripe error| Err500d["500"]
    CreateSession --> SavePending["savePendingCheckout\n(Redis key checkout:sessionId + a\ncheckout:active:userId:planId pointer,\nstatus: open, TTL 24h)"]
    SavePending -->|redis error| Err500f["500\n(harmless - the Stripe session\nstill expires on its own)"]
    SavePending --> Return200["200 { sessionId, url }"]
    Return200 --> Redirect(["client redirects user to\nthe Stripe-hosted url"])
```

`ensureStripeCustomer` re-reads `user.stripeCustomerId` from Postgres on every
call rather than trusting the session object: better-auth can serve a
Redis-cached `user` blob without querying Postgres at all, and this function's
own raw DB write bypasses the adapter hook that would otherwise refresh that
cache - so a value read from the session can be stale. It also passes a
`customer-<userId>` Stripe idempotency key, so a retried call can't create a
second customer (though it doesn't fully dedupe two truly simultaneous requests
- Stripe's idempotency semantics don't strictly guarantee that).

`GET /checkout/:sessionId` (`getCheckoutStatus`) answers the client's polling: it
reads the `purchase` row if one exists yet (`paid`/`refunded`/`disputed`), otherwise
falls back to the pending Redis entry (`open`/`processing`/`failed`/`expired` - the
last two are short-lived terminal states, see `markFailed`/`markExpired` below),
otherwise `null` → 404. 404 is reserved for a session the user never had at all;
`failed`/`expired` both answer with 200 so a polling client can tell "your payment
failed" apart from "this session never existed."

## Stripe webhook dispatch

Every Stripe event - recurring or one-time - lands on the **same** endpoint,
`/api/auth/stripe/webhook`, owned by `@better-auth/stripe`. It verifies the
signature, handles `customer.subscription.*` internally (writing the
`subscription` table directly), then *always* forwards the raw event to the
`onEvent` hook this app wired up to `handleStripeEvent` in `lib/webhook.ts` -
regardless of event type.

Its own `checkout.session.completed` handler runs for **every** session mode
except `"setup"` - including one-time (`mode: "payment"`) sessions, not just
subscription ones. For a one-time session it calls `subscriptions.retrieve`
with no subscription id, which throws and is caught and logged internally as
`"Stripe webhook failed"` on every single one-time purchase - noisy, but
harmless, and worth knowing about so it isn't mistaken for a real error during
on-call triage (see "known noise" below).

    end
```

`ALLOWED_EVENTS` (`lib/constants.ts`): `checkout.session.completed`,
`checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`, `checkout.session.async_payment_failed`,
`checkout.session.expired`, `charge.refunded`, `charge.dispute.created`,
`charge.dispute.closed`. Everything else (including every subscription event) is
a no-op for this feature - the plugin already dealt with it above.

### `handleStripeEvent`'s switch

```mermaid

    E["event.type"] --> CSC{"checkout.session.completed\n(mode: payment only)"}
    CSC -- payment_status: unpaid --> MarkProcessing["markProcessing(session.id)\nRedis TTL extended to 14 days\n(delayed payment methods, e.g. bank debits)"]
    CSC -- otherwise paid --> Confirm["confirmCheckout(session)"]

    E --> APS["async_payment_succeeded\n(mode: payment)"] --> Confirm
    E --> APF["async_payment_failed\n(mode: payment)"] --> MarkFailed["markFailed(session.id)\n(short-lived terminal status,\nfrees the (user, plan) slot right away)"]
    E --> Exp["checkout.session.expired\n(mode: payment)"] --> MarkExpired["markExpired(session.id)\n(same, status: expired)"]

    E --> Ref["charge.refunded"] --> UpdByCharge1["updateByCharge(payment_intent)"]
    E --> DispC["charge.dispute.created"] --> UpdByCharge2["updateByCharge(payment_intent)"]
    E --> DispX["charge.dispute.closed"] --> UpdByCharge2
```

### `confirmCheckout`: turning a paid session into a `purchase` row

Both drop branches below **throw** rather than log-and-return: a silently
swallowed 200 would mean a payment with no trace of ever going wrong (Stripe
never retries, and a later reconciler pass that hits the same drop would
otherwise miscount it as a successful insert - see the reconciler section).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start(["confirmCheckout(session)"]) --> ResolveOwner["resolveOwner:\ngetPendingCheckout(session.id)"]
    ResolveOwner --> HasPending{"pending entry\nfound in Redis?"}
    HasPending -- yes --> Owner["{ userId, planId }"]
    HasPending -- no, or Redis error --> Metadata["fall back to\nsession.metadata\n(set on the session at createCheckout time)"]
    Metadata --> HasMetadata{"metadata has\nuserId + planId?"}
    HasMetadata -- no --> Throw1["throw\n(logged first: payments.webhook.metadata)"]
    HasMetadata -- yes --> Owner

    Owner --> FetchPlan["paymentsRepo.plan.get(planId)"]
    FetchPlan --> PlanFound{"plan still exists?"}
    PlanFound -- no --> Throw2["throw\n(logged first: payments.webhook.plan_missing)"]
    PlanFound -- yes --> RepeatCheck{"!plan.repeatable?"}

    RepeatCheck -- no --> AddPurchase
    RepeatCheck -- yes --> Blocking["paymentsRepo.purchase.getBlockingByPlan(userId, planId)"]
    Blocking --> AlreadyOwns{"a blocking purchase\nfor a DIFFERENT session\nalready exists?"}
    AlreadyOwns -- no --> AddPurchase
    AlreadyOwns -- yes --> LogDup["log error: payments.webhook.duplicate_purchase\n+ audit log: duplicate_purchase_confirmed\n(best-effort; the money's already taken,\nso this still falls through to AddPurchase -\nthe financial record must never be dropped)"]
    LogDup --> AddPurchase

    AddPurchase["paymentsRepo.purchase.add:\npurchasedAt = session.created (not insert time)\nexpiresAt = plan.durationDays ? purchasedAt + durationDays : null\nINSERT ... ON CONFLICT (stripeCheckoutSessionId) DO NOTHING\n(on a user_id FK violation - the user was deleted\nmid-checkout - retries once with userId: null)"]
    AddPurchase --> RemovePending["removePendingCheckout(session.id)\n(best-effort; a leftover key just expires via its TTL)"]
```

`addPurchase` is idempotent on `stripeCheckoutSessionId`, so a retried
`checkout.session.completed` (Stripe's at-least-once delivery) is a no-op the
second time. `createdAt`/`expiresAt` are derived from the Stripe session's own
`created` timestamp, not insert time - so a purchase recorded late (e.g. by the
reconciler) doesn't get bonus days of access. Each purchase's own `durationDays`
is snapshotted onto its row at insert time, independent of any other purchase
of the same plan or any later edit to the plan itself (see "checking active
access" below).

### `updateByCharge`: refunds and disputes

Never trusts a webhook event's own embedded payload for the resulting state -
Stripe doesn't guarantee delivery order, so an out-of-order or retried event's
payload can be stale. Always re-fetches the current charge/dispute from Stripe
instead (`resolveChargeState` in `lib/charge-state.ts`), the same function the
reconciler uses.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start(["updateByCharge(paymentIntent)"]) --> HasId{"payment_intent\npresent on the event?"}
    HasId -- no --> NoOp1["return (nothing to update)"]
    HasId -- yes --> Resolve["resolveChargeState(paymentIntentId):\nstripe.paymentIntents.retrieve(expand: latest_charge)\n+ stripe.disputes.list if charge.disputed"]
    Resolve --> HasCharge{"a charge\nexists on the intent?"}
    HasCharge -- no --> NoOp2["return"]
    HasCharge -- yes --> TryUpdate["updatePurchaseByPaymentIntent(target)"]
    TryUpdate --> Updated{"a purchase row\nwas updated?"}
    Updated -- yes --> Done["done"]
    Updated -- no --> Retrieve["stripe.paymentIntents.retrieve(id)\n(plain, no expand - just for metadata)"]
    Retrieve --> OursButMissing{"intent.metadata.planId\nset (one of our checkouts)?"}
    OursButMissing -- yes --> Throw["throw\n(confirmCheckout's insert is still\nin flight/retrying - fail so Stripe\nretries this event too)"]
    OursButMissing -- no --> Ignore["ignore\n(e.g. a subscription invoice charge\nwith no purchase row at all)"]
```

## The reconciler: `lib/reconcile.ts` (`bun run payments:reconcile`)

A backstop for webhooks Stripe gave up retrying. Lists recent one-time Checkout
Sessions directly from Stripe and, per session: inserts a `purchase` row via
`confirmCheckout` if none exists yet, then syncs refund/dispute state via the
same `resolveChargeState` the webhook uses. `scripts/reconcile.ts` is just its
CLI wrapper (arg parsing, exit code); the logic importable from `lib/reconcile.ts`
is what `reconcile.test.ts` exercises directly.

Counting is tied to what actually happened, not attempted: `inserted` only
increments once `confirmCheckout` has actually resolved (or, in `--dry-run`,
would have been attempted) - if it throws (an unresolvable owner, a deleted
plan), that exception propagates out and the session is counted as `failed`
instead, never silently miscounted as a successful insert.

The default scan window is 14 days (derived from `PROCESSING_TTL_SEC`), not 7 -
delayed payment methods (e.g. bank debits) can take that long to settle, and a
late settlement whose webhook was lost needs to still fall inside the window.

## Checking active access: `hasActivePurchase`

Nothing calls this yet, but it's the intended way to answer "does this user
currently have access to this plan" once something needs to. Storage is always
independent rows - each purchase's own `durationDays` is snapshotted at
purchase time, never chained with any other purchase's - so `plan.overlapping`
only changes how they're *read*: `overlapping: false` recomputes each
purchase's end as `(chain-adjusted start) + its own durationDays`, rather than
trusting its independently-computed `expiresAt`, so a later purchase bought
before an earlier one lapses correctly extends access instead of shortening it.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start(["hasActivePurchase(userId, planId, plan.overlapping)"]) --> Fetch["SELECT paid purchases for (userId, planId)\nORDER BY createdAt ASC"]
    Fetch --> Overlap{"plan.overlapping?"}

    Overlap -- true --> AnyActive{"any purchase has\nexpiresAt IS NULL\nor expiresAt > now?"}
    AnyActive -- yes --> True1["true"]
    AnyActive -- no --> False1["false"]

    Overlap -- false --> Walk["walk purchases in order,\nchaining: start = max(chainEnd, createdAt)"]
    Walk --> PerDuration{"this purchase's\nown durationDays?"}
    PerDuration -- "null (perpetual)" --> NowPast{"now >= start?"}
    NowPast -- yes --> True2["true"]
    NowPast -- no --> False2["false"]
    PerDuration -- "set" --> Recompute["end = start + durationDays\n(recomputed from the chain-adjusted start,\nnot the purchase's own stored expiresAt)"]
    Recompute --> InWindow{"start <= now < end?"}
    InWindow -- yes --> True3["true"]
    InWindow -- no --> Advance["chainEnd = end,\nmove to next purchase\n(a gap before the next one isn't backfilled)"]
    Advance --> Walk
    Walk -->|no purchases left| False3["false"]
```

## The audit log: `payment_audit_log`

A persistent, queryable trail of the races around `plan.repeatable` that the
two `POST /checkout` guards and `confirmCheckout`'s own re-check write to -
`checkout_blocked_existing_purchase`, `checkout_blocked_pending_checkout`, and
`duplicate_purchase_confirmed` (the one where money was actually taken for an
already-owned non-repeatable plan, and the purchase is still recorded - see
above). All three writes are best-effort: a failure is logged as a warning and
never blocks the response or webhook outcome it's attached to. Not yet exposed
through any route - query it directly, or via `paymentsRepo.auditLog.getByUser`.

## Where `repeatable`, `durationDays` and `overlapping` come from

All three live on `plan` and only matter for `type: one_time` (a `recurring`
plan's lifecycle is governed by its Stripe subscription period instead, and
`insertPlanSchema` rejects `durationDays` on recurring plans):

| Column | Meaning | Read by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `repeatable` | can the same user buy this plan more than once at all | `POST /checkout`'s and `confirmCheckout`'s `getBlockingByPlan` guards (a `paid` or `disputed` purchase blocks; only `refunded` frees the slot) |
| `durationDays` | days of access one purchase grants from its own `createdAt`; `null` = never expires | `addPurchase`, which snapshots it onto `purchase.durationDays` and derives `purchase.expiresAt` from it |
| `overlapping` | when a user has multiple paid purchases of the plan, can their access windows run concurrently (`true`) or must a later one chain on after an earlier one expires (`false`) | `hasActivePurchase` |

## Known noise / tech debt (not fixed here)

- **Spurious plugin log on every one-time purchase** - see "Stripe webhook
  dispatch" above. Vendor behavior (`@better-auth/stripe`'s
  `onCheckoutSessionCompleted` doesn't early-return for `mode: "payment"`); no
  code fix without patching the dependency.
- **Dependency version mismatch** - this repo runs `stripe@23`, but
  `@better-auth/stripe`'s declared peer range stops at `^22` (and separately,
  its peer on `better-auth` itself is `^1.7.7` while this repo runs `1.7.4`).
  Nothing is currently broken; revisit if an actual incompatibility surfaces.
